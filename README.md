**Customer Review Text Classification**

This project classifies customer reviews into multiple categories using machine learning models. The dataset underwent preprocessing, including tokenization, cleaning, and embedding using Langchain. Various models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, RandomForest, LGB, CatBoost) were evaluated, with CatBoost providing the best results. The model was deployed to predict categories for new reviews and validated using a separate test dataset.

The project is implemented in Google Colab. For further details, please refer to the detailed report file.
